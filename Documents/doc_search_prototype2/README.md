# 🧠 AI Document Search & Feedback System for Oil & Gas Engineering

This project is an intelligent document search pipeline tailored for oil and gas plant design engineering documents. It uses NLP and vector search to find relevant content from engineering documents (e.g., piping layout guides, electrical classifications) and learns continuously from user feedback.
